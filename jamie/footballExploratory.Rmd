## Pipes

```{r}
players %>%

```

```{r}
players %>%
  colnames
```
```{r}
players %>%
  sapply(class)

class %>%
  sapply(players,.)

## SELECT ~ select

```{r}
players %>%
  head %>%
  select(player_name, birthday)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT player_name
,   birthday
FROM Player
LIMIT 6
")
```

## WHERE ~ filter

```{r}
players %>%
  filter(birthday >= "1998") %>%
  head

dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
Select birthday
from player
where birthday > '1998'
limit 5
")
```

## ORDER ~ arrange

```{r}
players %>%
  arrange(birthday) %>%
  head

dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
select birthday
from player
order by birthday
limit 5
           ")
```

## aggregators ~ summarise

```{r}

```

## mutate

```{r}

## GROUP BY

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(height=mean(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, height)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()

dbGetQuery(sql_con,
           "select cast(substr(birthday,1,4) as numeric) as year, count(1), avg(height) as height
           from player 
           group by year") %>% ggplot(aes(year, height)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()

```
```{r}

  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(nsample=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, nsample)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
players %>%

Exercise

* Translate from SQL to dply or from dply to SQL
```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
")

Match %>%
  head %>%
  
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
")
```
```{r}
countries
```


```{r}
games %>%
  left_join(countries, by=c("country_id" = "id")) %>%
  select(name, home_team_api_id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(teams = n_distinct(home_team_api_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(teams))
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player_Attributes
LIMIT 6
")

```

* From where do players with higest accuracy come from?

* Add team name and translate to dplyr

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT stage, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal
FROM Match
WHERE country_id = 1
AND season = '2008/2009'
ORDER BY stage
")
```
